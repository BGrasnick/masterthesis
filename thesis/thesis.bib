@article{Fang2011,
abstract = {Microarray data classification is one of the major interests in health informatics that aims at discovering hidden patterns in gene expression profiles. The main challenge in building this classification system is the curse of dimensionality problem. Thus, there is a considerable amount of studies on gene selection method for building effective classification models. However, most of the approaches consider solely on gene expression values, and as a result, the selected genes might not be biologically meaningful. This paper presents an integrative gene selection for improving microarray data classification performance. The proposed approach employed the association analysis technique to integrate both gene expression and biological data in identifying informative genes. The experimental results show that the proposed gene selection outperformed the traditional method in terms of accuracy and number of selected genes.},

abstract = {Feature selection has become elementary tool for processing high dimensional data. DNA microarray technology is used for the study of large number of genes simultaneously, which helps in determining the expression levels of the genes. Gene selection using high dimensional gene expression data is foremost and imperative for prediction and classification of disease. This gene expression data can be shown in the form of matrix and usually contains irrelevant, redundant and noisy data, so the study and analysis of data becomes very problematic. The prime purpose of feature selection approaches is to remove the curse of dimensionality, improve the performance and accuracy of classification and clustering algorithms by the elimination of these irrelevant features and reduction of noise. This paper explains the taxonomy of feature selection methods stating their respective pros and cons. It also presents a review on few feature selection approaches, mainly those that have been proposed over the past few years.},

abstract = {The development of microarray technology has supplied a large volume of data to many fields. In particular, it has been applied to prediction and diagnosis of cancer, so that it expectedly helps us to exactly predict and diagnose cancer. To precisely classify cancer we have to select genes related to cancer because extracted genes from microarray have many noises. In this paper, we attempt to explore many features and classifiers using three benchmark datasets to systematically evaluate the performances of the feature selection methods and machine learning classifiers. Three benchmark datasets are Leukemia cancer dataset, Colon cancer dataset and Lymphoma cancer data set. Pearson's and Spearman's correlation coefficients, Euclidean distance, cosine coefficient, information gain, mutual information and signal to noise ratio have been used for feature selection. Multi-layer perceptron, k-nearest neighbour, support vector machine and structure adaptive self–organizing map have been used for classification. Also, we have combined the classifiers to improve the performance of classification. Experimental results show that the ensemble with several basis classifiers produces the best recognition rate on the benchmark dataset.},
