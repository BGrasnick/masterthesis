\chapter*{Abstract}

High-throughput sequencing technologies produce huge gene expression datasets. 
They are analyzed for improving understanding of how diseases work.
The high-dimensionality of this data poses computational challenges to their analysis.
In order to reduce this problem, feature selection approaches used.
Most feature selection methods are computational only.
A few new approaches additionally integrate external biological knowledge leading to better interpretability.
This paper presents a framework for combining and comparing knowledge based and computational feature selection. 
Moreover, we developed a simple novel integrative method of the combination of both approaches. 
Results on a cancer dataset show that simple computational methods enriched by external knowledge can compete with complex computational techniques. 
The flexibility of the presented framework allows more in-depth comparisons with different datasets, external biological knowledge sources and feature selection methods.
