\label{chapter:conclusion}

This paper presented a framework for comparing both computational and knowledge based FS methods for gene expression data. 
Moreover, a novel integrative method of combining both approaches was presented. 
The results show that while the knowledge based approach performs worse than computational techniques, a combination of both is promising. 
The combination of simple computational methods with external knowledge leads to performance improvements and can compete with more complex methods that might be unfeasible given a dataset that is very large. 
In addition to the low computational complexity, the integration of biological knowledge leads to a better interpretability of the selected genes and their connection to the diseases under study.
